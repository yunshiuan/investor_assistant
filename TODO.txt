    () compute the average cost of each target of each investor
() write README
() add a 'show all' button for 'show transaction'
() For "add a transaction"
  - () use combo box for investors and targets
  - () use date picker for date
() move 'tableRecords' from the field of Recorder to the field of Investor
  () to facilitate the update of 'average cost' in each investor's portfolio
() add a class 'portfolioNode', which has fields:

- should support 'dividend' as one of the transaction type
- for the button 'show transactions': use tableView to show the transactions instead of a text area.
